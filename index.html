    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Stanton Anthony. And Kaylee thinks I am cute. I think she's cute too. Anyways, I love playing different sports, thinking logically, and spending quality time in the outdoors. 
      My father was born and raised in Australia, while my mother was born and raised in Malaysia. My father was born to Lebanese parents, and my mom is full chinese. I have enjoyed having such a
      rich heritage being raised in Utah, where most people don't know where Lebanon or Malaysia is.</p>
